Simply Google ‘Men and Loneliness,’ and you will find countless [articles](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/18/health/male-loneliness-epidemic-wellness/index.html) written just this year that dig into the profound social annexation so many men are grappling with. There are even [retreats ](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/mens-retreat-program-aims-address-growing-male-loneliness/story?id=99869223)selling out aimed at addressing male loneliness.

Men are at a breaking point. The systematic trauma of hyper-masculinity has taken many men to a place where they can’t share their feelings. They can’t connect to their emotions and aren’t able to ask for help. Statements like ‘Man Up’ and ‘Grow a Pair’ have done us no favors.

As the rest of the world explores the world of ‘well-being’ more and more, men are floundering to catch up. We see this in coaching on a daily basis. Men feel like they are not seen and heard or feel like they are alone on their journey. When men connect deeper with other men, they realize they are not alone. Then, they can remove the mask, open up, and find connections, which help them be better co-workers, fathers, husbands, and friends.

## Ways of combating male loneliness:

- 

**Connect with others.** Men need to find connections with other men. Look for sports teams, outdoor activities, Father’s events, etc. Political groups may not be the best place, as anger often flares up there, and men need places to connect with joy and vulnerability.

- **Take a break from social media.** We know people often compare themselves to others on social media apps and can feel less than. Keep screen time to a minimum and instead connect with friends and family IRL.

- **Join a men’s group.** There are countless men’s groups around the country and online, such as [EVRYMAN](https://evryman.com/) and [Mankind Project](https://mankindproject.org/). These organizations focus on men’s mental health and finding connections healthily and sustainably. As Yung Pueblo stated in his recent book, Lighter, group work can be collective liberation in the context of undoing systems of oppression—in this case, oppression men put upon themselves.

- **Work with a life coach**. Coaches can be great resources for digging deeper into emotional vulnerability and for providing tools to connect better with others and yourself. Men who work with other male coaches can find camaraderie together, and this may be the first man they have ever been vulnerable with. It’s a safe space to break the cycle and find support and resources to continue the journey.
