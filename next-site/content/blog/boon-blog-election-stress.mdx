**And How Personalized Support Can Help**

In offices across the United States, political conversations increase as election day nears, posing a potential threat to cohesion.

It’s important to note that stress and division is particularly high this decade. From 2016 to 2020, election stress grew from 52% to **68% among U.S. adults (**[**American Psychological Association**](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/10/election-stress)**)**. On top of that, [political-related violence and threats are on the rise.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-political-violence-and-violent-threats-are-on-the-rise-in-the-united-states)

For HR leaders, this presents a challenge: How can you support your employees through political stress while maintaining a productive and inclusive work environment?

### **1. Acknowledge and Address Political Stress**

Ignoring election-related stress is a mistake. Employees are experiencing anxiety around the political climate, and it can impact their performance. Encourage open dialogue, but with boundaries. **Create guidelines** for respectful political discussions at work, ensuring that conversations remain civil and do not disrupt the team.

### **2. Provide Personalized 1:1 Support**

Employees experience political stress differently, and this is where **personalized support** can be invaluable. Offering access to **1:1 coaching** or mental health support allows employees to process their feelings in a confidential, safe space. Personal support helps employees manage their emotions without carrying that stress into their workday.

### **3. Foster Psychological Safety**

It’s important that your workplace feels like a safe space for everyone, regardless of political beliefs. Psychological safety is key to maintaining productivity. [**Harvard Business Review**](https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety) found that teams with high psychological safety are **12% more productive**. Create opportunities for employees to engage in stress-relieving activities or access mindfulness resources during high-stress periods.

### **4. Implement Long-Term Solutions**

Election stress is cyclical, but it can have a lasting impact. Building **resilience** in employees is critical, as it prepares them to handle stress from all sources—both personal and professional. Provide ongoing resources for mental health support, stress management training, and **encourage work-life balance** to help employees build long-term resilience.
