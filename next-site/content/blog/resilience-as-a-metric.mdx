## Why Resilience?

Firstly, at Boon, we believe that resilience is the best predictor of a happy, full life. It is associated with longevity, lower rates of depression, and greater satisfaction with life (Harvard Health Publishing, 2017). Moreover, research confirms that increases in employee resilience contribute to the following:

- Improved work performance (self and supervisor rated)

- Higher levels of motivation and effort at work

- Job satisfaction and happiness

- Greater commitment to the employer

Additionally, increased resiliency can improve coping abilities for those with existing mental health conditions (Mayo Clinic, 2020). Resilience training assists 9/11 survivors and military veterans in managing their stress and dealing with severe trauma (Newman, 2005). Therefore, in light of this research and practice, Boon has chosen resilience as our main metric for success and progress for clients.

## Our Measure of Resilience

Boon uses the **Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10)** to track the resiliency of clients over time. ***Clients complete the CD-RISC-10 over time: before their first coaching session through the Boon Welcome Survey and again after every six coaching sessions.*** The CD-RISC-10 is one of the most academically accepted surveys for measuring resilience. The CD-RISC was created to assess resilience over time in adult and child populations diagnosed with PTSD and has been established as valid and reliable across populations. 

Scoring: Scoring of the scale is based on summing the total of all items, each of which is scored from 0-4. Then, for the CD-RISC, the total score ranges from 0-40 with lowest to highest quartiles being:

- Quartile 1: 0-29

- Quartile 2: 30-32

- Quartile 3: 33-36

- Quartile 4: 37-40 

In the US, the average score is 32 for the general population. 

Examples:

A score of 28 would place an individual in the lowest 25% of resilience.

A score of 36 would be in the third quartile, and 25% of the population would score higher.

## Illustrative Results To-Date

Employees who use Boon’s coaching services average a 20% improvement in their CD-RISC 10 resilience score after just six coaching sessions with their Boon coach.
