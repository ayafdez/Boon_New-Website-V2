This month, my reflection is timely as Boon lifts a glass to toast its third anniversary. Boon is celebrating an incredible journey. Boon boasts 34,000 coaching sessions, 200 coaches, 85 customers, and a 21-country client reach. I've been with Boon since the beginning and see firsthand how passionate, focused, and driven its leadership team is. Boon has created something powerful and purposeful these last three years. I’m also reflecting on my own experience as a Boon coach.             

## **The Best Job in the World!**

Upon reflection, I tell anyone who will listen that I have the best job in the world. I am not at all ashamed to admit that. To me, coaching is absolute magic.  It’s the transformative component that supports people in shifting from “doing well” to becoming optimally functioning powerhouses. It helps clients see patterns they may have overlooked and identify limiting beliefs holding them back from their true potential. It exposes them to tools and frameworks that will support their path to success (that’s success based on their definition).  I feel passionately connected to and fulfilled by the work I do with my clients. It really doesn’t feel like work at all.  Being part of the Boon Health coaching team has been a gift.  Boon has created an environment where their roster of coaches can thrive, learn from, and collaborate. This is done through providing compassionate, present, and supportive leadership.  Through Boon, I’ve had the privilege of coaching the most brilliant and talented humans, humans who inspire me every day.

## **The Client as Muse   *                ***

**When I think back on all of the extraordinary clients I’ve worked with as a Boon coach over these past three years, I’m humbled by just how much I’ve learned from each of them:**

- I’ve learned patience and determination from leaders at all levels who are working hard to shift their companies’ cultures.

- I’ve learned the importance of accountability and responsibility from those who’ve made missteps and have not shied away from the consequences or necessary strategy changes that followed.

- I’ve learned the true power of courage and authenticity from those who worked hard to set boundaries and reassess their professional goals and definitions of success to live more balanced lives.

**I’ve also witnessed clients confront and overcome some truly incredible challenges and obstacles as a result of our work:**

- I’ve watched new CEOs work tirelessly to gain the respect of seasoned board members and become trusted leaders and decision-makers.

- I’ve watched clients find their voice and then use that voice to provide tough but critical feedback to their leaders and advocate for their growth and development.

- I’ve watched clients navigate complex transitions that weren’t of their choosing while gracefully leading team members through those same transitions. *** ***

**Witnessing these growth journeys, transitions, and successes has helped me be a more present, empathetic, and collaborative coach and inspired me to be bolder and more courageous in my own life. Like I said, the best job in the world. **

## **Reflecting on** **The Power of Coaching **

Companies that invest in coaching for their employees reap tremendous benefits.  Coaching supports leaders at all levels in strengthening their resilience, creating strategies to manage and mitigate stress and burnout, and developing essential skills like collaborating efficiently, providing impact-based, actionable feedback, and making effective decisions.  It arms people with the tools, best practices, and frameworks needed to help them thrive day-to-day.  For companies, the byproduct is an increase in overall fulfillment, productivity, and focus within their teams.  Working for a company that invests in its employees’ growth, resilience, and well-being creates empowered, present leaders at all levels. It lets employees know they are seen and heard and that their success matters as much as the organization’s success.
