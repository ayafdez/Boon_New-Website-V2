Take a trip down memory lane.

This example is a common metaphor for a reason — think about the first time you learned how to ride a bike.

**It likely looked something like this:**

- 

Starting with training wheels

- Graduating to two wheels, as your confidence grew

- Rocky starts that sometimes requires you to slow down to regain balance

You probably even fell a few times.

But you got the hang of it, and before long, you could ride long distances with no problem.

Now, imagine a different version of this familiar story.

- 

You never got training wheels

- You wobble and fall all the time

- You get banged up, cut, and scraped all the time

Is it likely you’d still learn how to ride, eventually?

Sure. Except it will probably take longer. And some people might quit under these conditions.

Boon coach Rumeena Bhalla found the latter to be common among her clients who were recently promoted to management level.

Things need to change so that the former example is the rule rather than the exception.

## There Are Better Ways to Equip New Managers for Success

New managers are often thrust into leadership positions without training, especially at fast-moving startups with inadequate resources for professional development.

It's just “all hands on deck.”

In addition, newly promoted leaders at all sorts of companies often have to continue juggling what they were doing in their previous roles even as they transition to their new ones. This can result in a lot of time spent putting out fires in both positions.

In both these cases, and in many other similar examples, new managers aren’t getting the breathing room they need to gradually step into their leadership roles.

They never had their time with training wheels.

If you recently promoted or hired a new cohort to management or are new to management and need some direction, here are Rumeena’s three tips for mitigating stress during the transition from associate/specialist to newly minted manager.

### 1. **Learn to delegate**.

New managers promoted from within will likely be expected to keep taking the lead on old responsibilities. For a while, it’s reasonable to tie up loose ends and give as much information and guidance to the person assuming their previous role as possible — but encourage them to set a deadline. This will remove other people's expectations of relying on them to do their previous role on top of the new one.

Delegate any other low-level tasks appropriately so that you can make time for the new or more extensive projects you need to spearhead.

### 2. **Be fiercely protective of your time.**

There will be occasions when new managers work late or earlier than usual. But again, leaders should be careful to set these expectations. When we respond to things late at night, people might expect us to always be responsive at that time.

### 3.** Be realistic with yourself.**

A to-do list is just proof of life. If your manager and leaders are busy professionals, they will always have stuff to do. They’ll never get to the bottom of it, and that’s normal. Instead, call it a today list. Advise your managers to layer in weekly goals over long-term, six-month, or annual goals — so they can leave room for change and adaptation and protect their motivation.

## Your Policies and Practices In This Area Will Have Ripple Effects

The employees you promote to management or hire to bring order to a troublesome situation or a growth opportunity are often your top performers. If they aren’t given the space or resources to thrive in their new position, this can quickly lead to a burn-and-churn cycle that affects the rest of your teams.

Following these three simple tips could help you on the path to success when it comes to empowering new managers. And think about what 30-45 minutes of 1:1 coaching with experts like Rumeena Bhalla could do for your top performers.
