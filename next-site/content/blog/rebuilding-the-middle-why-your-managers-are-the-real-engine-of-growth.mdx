## Let’s get real:

Most companies say they care about developing leaders, but when it comes to actually supporting the people in the middle—the managers—they fall flat.

And yet, your managers are the ones translating vision into execution. They're guiding teams, holding culture, and putting out daily fires. They’re the engine keeping your business running, growing, and evolving. So why are they often the most under-supported group in your org?

It’s time to rebuild the middle.

## The Problem with How We Treat Managers

Let’s start with the obvious: Managers are overworked and underprepared.

They’re promoted based on performance, not people skills. Given direct reports without support. Asked to lead while still executing. And maybe—maybe—they get a two-day “manager bootcamp” and some HR PDFs.

No wonder so many of them are burned out, checked out, or actively disengaged. It’s not a “manager performance” problem. It’s a systems problem.

## Managers Aren’t Just Messengers—They’re Multipliers

Here’s what most companies miss: Managers are not a middle layer to manage—they’re multipliers of business impact.

According to Gallup, managers account for 70% of the variance in employee engagement. Think about that. Every time you invest in a manager, you’re influencing the experience, productivity, and retention of their entire team.

Now imagine what happens when you don’t invest.

## Coaching > Training: What Managers Really Need

Traditional training programs aren’t cutting it. Why?

Because behavior doesn’t change in a classroom. It changes in real-time, with support, reflection, and accountability.

That’s where coaching comes in.

At Boon, we coach the whole person—not just the job title. Whether it’s navigating hard conversations, building psychological safety, or learning how to delegate, we meet managers where they are. Our platform delivers scalable, affordable 1:1 and group coaching that actually fits into the flow of work.

No more one-size-fits-all. No more “hope they figure it out.” Just real development, for the people who make your company work.

It’s Not “Nice to Have.” It’s Core Strategy.

Let’s stop treating manager support like a perk. When your managers grow, your business grows.
