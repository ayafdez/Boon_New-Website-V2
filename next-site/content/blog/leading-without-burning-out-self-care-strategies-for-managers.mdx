### **Great Leaders Don’t Just Manage Teams—They Manage Themselves**

We hear it all the time: *“I’m always on. I can’t unplug. My to-do list never ends.”*

For managers, **burnout isn’t a possibility—it’s a real risk**. The pressure to **support teams, hit goals, and make decisions** can quickly lead to **exhaustion, stress, and disengagement**.

Here’s the truth: **You can’t lead effectively if you’re running on empty.**

That’s why the best managers in 2025 are **prioritizing self-care as a leadership strategy**—not just a luxury.

## 
**Why Leadership Burnout Is Real (And Costly)**

🚨 **50% of managers experience burnout.**
🚨 **Burned-out leaders create disengaged teams.**
🚨 **Companies with high burnout see 2X higher turnover.**

Without proper **stress management and boundaries**, managers **struggle to make decisions, support their teams, and stay engaged**—which affects **business outcomes**.

The solution? **Self-care isn’t selfish—it’s a leadership skill.**

**How to Prevent Leadership Burnout**

### **1. Set Clear Boundaries (Without Feeling Guilty)**

A manager’s **“always available” mindset** leads straight to burnout. The best leaders:
✔️ **Define work hours and stick to them.**
✔️ **Model healthy boundaries for their team.**
✔️ **Learn to say “no” without guilt.**

### **2. Prioritize Energy, Not Just Time**

Burnout isn’t just about hours worked—it’s about **energy drained**. Effective managers:
✔️ **Take breaks without feeling unproductive.**
✔️ **Identify energy-draining tasks and delegate when possible.**
✔️ **Schedule deep work time for strategic thinking.**

### **3. Build Emotional Resilience**

High-stress leadership roles require **emotional intelligence and self-awareness**. Managers can:
✔️ **Practice mindfulness to manage stress.**
✔️ **Use coaching techniques to reframe challenges.**
✔️ **Recognize burnout signals before they escalate.**

### **4. Get Support Through Coaching**

Even the best leaders need guidance. Coaching helps managers:
✔️ **Develop self-awareness and emotional resilience.**
✔️ **Navigate stress and overwhelm with expert strategies.**
✔️ **Stay accountable for their own well-being.**
