Last week, I was coaching a client on setting 2024 professional goals for themselves and their teams.  As we were finishing up the session, they asked: “If you don’t mind me asking, what are your goals for 2024?”  

This question is always a bit awkward for me to answer.  Simply stating, “I don’t set goals for myself,” feels weird, given that as a professional development coach, I work with clients nearly every day on goal setting and achieving those goals.  It’s not that I don’t have things I’m working toward or milestones I want to achieve, but I tend to approach a new year with a less structured approach.  So, how do you set out on the right New Year’s path without setting goals?               

## **What goals do I want to experience?**

I like to start by focusing on what I’m looking to experience in the year ahead.  This approach puts you in a more holistic mindset that transcends mere achievement and places more of an emphasis on personal growth, meaningful connection, and even just pure joy.  Setting concrete goals is too rigid for some people; focusing on experiences provides room for flexibility and gives one the opportunity to change course more freely.  It encourages one to be present, making diverse opportunities more visible.  Want to shift your focus from traditional goal setting to envisioning experiences?  Consider asking yourself the following questions:

- What am I looking to learn about myself this year? 

- Which emotions do I want to feel when it comes to the work I’m doing?

- Within what new spaces do I want to see myself? 

- What makes the most sense to cultivate?

- Who do I want to collaborate with?  

## **What do I want to leave behind?    **

A good next step is to consider some of the things you’d like to leave behind.  Think of this as an opportunity to take stock of all the behaviors, habits, and thought patterns that serve or no longer serve you.  Consider precisely the things that have hindered your personal or professional growth or things that come to feel inauthentic to you.  By consciously choosing to release what no longer serves you, you gain a deep sense of empowerment; this allows you to head into any new cycle armed with only what you need for success.  Not sure what to leave behind?  

### Think about things like:

- Limiting beliefs around which spaces you belong in

- Having less than complete confidence in your abilities

- Playing small

- Settling for less than what you want and have earned

- Not advocating for your professional development

- Negative self-talk that has no evidence to support it
