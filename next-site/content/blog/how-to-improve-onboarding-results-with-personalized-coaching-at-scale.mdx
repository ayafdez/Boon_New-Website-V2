First impressions and first days. They can taint how we view the entirety of a thing.

Or they can ensure we feel confident to hit the ground running

Any kind of “first” is usually quick and short-lived. Firsts mark just a small percentage of an experience, but they can foreshadow what an individual expects moving forward.

Onboarding at a new job is one of the many “firsts” we experience, and it affects how the initial 3-6 months will go for new hires. These months also often set the tone for the remainder of an employee’s tenure with the organization.

Yet companies don’t invest enough in onboarding.

## Onboarding By The Numbers: It’s Not Great, Bob

Onboarding processes are a differentiator between a workforce that loses or keeps their talent. In 2021, Gallup Analytics found that only 12% of U.S. employees believe “the company they work for has a satisfactory onboarding process.” An effective onboarding process can increase retention of new hires by 82%, [as found by a well-known study for Glassdoor by Brandon Hall Group](https://b2b-assets.glassdoor.com/the-true-cost-of-a-bad-hire.pdf).

At Amazon, onboarding isn't just a process — it's a critical strategy for success. When Boon CEO Alex Simmons sat down with Donna Alexander on our “[Have a Better Day](https://www.boon-health.com/blog/learn-amazons-onboarding-secrets)” podcast, she revealed that, when she was leading onboarding processes at the $1.8T company, there were three common assumptions she avoided.

## Three Common Assumptions HR Leaders Should Avoid

### **1. That Employees Know Their Role**

One major pitfall in onboarding is assuming new hires understand their role and the company’s operations regardless of title. Donna highlights that job titles like "account manager" can vary greatly across organizations, especially ones that are rapidly growing.

To avoid confusion, Amazon ensures clarity from day one, providing detailed role descriptions and expectations. This proactive approach helps new hires hit the ground running, fully understanding their responsibilities.

### **2. That One-Size-Fits-All Works for Onboarding**

Every role and location requires a different onboarding approach. Customization is necessary and is one reason why a company like Amazon has scaled to over 30 countries. Their onboarding process is tailored to fit roles and teams. A personalized approach ensures that each employee gets the most relevant training and support.

### **3. Expecting Perfection from Day One**

Expecting perfection immediately sets unrealistic standards. Donna underscores that onboarding should allow room for learning and adaptation. Every new hire has a learning curve, so regular check-ins and feedback loops are integral to their process and helps them grow into their roles without undue pressure.

## **So What Does Successful Onboarding Look Like**

Tests, quizzes and surveys are the easiest way to track things like productivity benchmarks, milestone competitions, ramp-up times, or other critical metrics important to the team the employee is joining. This is also the easiest way to identify common areas where new hires are struggling, which helps refine training materials. Recognize that new hires can vary in their productivity markers.

Amazon's onboarding success hinges on clear, measurable milestones.

Donna emphasizes the importance of 30, 60, and 90-day completion rates to ensure new hires are progressing as expected. Beyond these milestones, she also recommends tracking diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) metrics, and manager satisfaction. This comprehensive approach helps Amazon not only onboard effectively but also foster an inclusive culture from day one.

### Is Your HR Team Short on Person Power? Or Need A Reboot or Some Perspective?

Just like [recently promoted managers](https://www.boon-health.com/blog/3-things-to-remember-when-promoting-or-hiring-new-managers), your new hires face novelty on a few different fronts, and will need time and support on their side to feel confident wading new waters solo. If you’re a company with a smaller HR team, or with onboarding and off-boarding SOPs still in development, coaching can often fill those gaps.
