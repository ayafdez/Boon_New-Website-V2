In the early stages of my professional life, the concept of “owning my career” was somewhat elusive. But when the challenges came, I learned to grow.

I’ve learned that true empowerment comes from embracing vulnerability and inviting others into my journey as a woman and leader.

This shift in mindset, from self-imposed limits to open receptivity, was a game-changer. It was also the moment I realized the power of coaching and feedback to take control of my career and life.

For me, stepping up and taking charge of our lives and careers has become a matter of collective personal responsibility.

We’re often taught to follow orders as children. But it’s time to break free from that narrative.

**Does this resonate with you?**

I remember being curious and eager to reach out to my first coach. After I voiced my questions and concerns, my coach asked, "*What would you like to take away from our time together*?"

That question brought a real moment of clarity: **I had the power to lead my own life and career.**

This was a chance to challenge the narrative of 'do as you're told' and instead pursue what I truly wanted. It was a moment of liberation, a realization that I had the freedom to choose my path.

**This is the power we all hold within us.**

**And you can do it, too.**

## **Choose to Lead and Own Your Career**

Here are some questions to guide your reflections. They’re meant to help you shift your mindset. When we envision your future, this naturally gets us moving towards creating and owning that future.
