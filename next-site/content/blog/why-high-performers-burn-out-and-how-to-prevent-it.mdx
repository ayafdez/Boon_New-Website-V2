**Let’s be real:**
Burnout isn’t just happening to the overwhelmed or the disengaged. It’s hitting your *highest performers*—the ones you rely on most. The ones who say yes. The ones who rarely ask for help. And by the time you notice, it’s often too late.

So why are high performers burning out? And more importantly, what can you *actually* do about it?

## **The Burnout Paradox**

High performers are often the most at risk for burnout—not because they’re incapable, but because they’re over-reliable.

Here’s what’s really going on:

- **They’re over-leveraged.** When you’re good at your job, you get more work. When you’re great, you get the work *no one else can do*. That creates a vicious cycle of pressure and over-responsibility.

- **They don’t want to let others down.** High performers internalize expectations. They often tie their self-worth to achievement and fear disappointing others more than burning themselves out.

- **They’re under-supported.** Being capable doesn’t mean they don’t need coaching, feedback, or space to grow. Most high performers are flying solo at altitudes where turbulence is inevitable.

- **They’ve outgrown the basics.** Traditional development programs are often too generic to challenge or support high achievers. They need something more tailored, more nuanced—more *human*.

## **Here’s what *doesn’t* work:**

- Telling them to “just take a vacation”

- Offering access to yet another meditation app

- Waiting until they ask for help (spoiler: they won’t)

These are *reactive* solutions to a *systemic* problem.

## **Here’s what does: Human-centered coaching**

At Boon, we believe burnout prevention isn’t about pushing less—it’s about *supporting more*. High performers need more than platitudes. They need personalized, real-time development that meets them where they are.

That’s where coaching comes in.

**With Boon, we help organizations:**

- **Identify hidden strain points** before burnout takes hold

- **Support high performers with 1:1 coaching** that tackles both career growth and personal resilience

- **Create cultures where asking for help is a strength, not a weakness**

- **Equip managers with the tools to recognize burnout early**—in themselves and their teams

## **Performance without burnout isn’t a pipe dream. It’s a coaching strategy.**

Your best people shouldn’t have to choose between high achievement and personal well-being. With scalable coaching solutions like **Boon Scale** and **Boon Grow**, you can embed burnout prevention directly into the employee experience—not as a perk, but as a performance investment.

Because when high performers feel supported, they don’t just stay—they *thrive*.
