**Welcome to Boon's Coaching Sessions!** You may or may not have experience with coaching, so we’d like to give you an overview of what to expect and how to prepare. Your coach will also provide you with some of this information, but there are a few things that you can do or become aware of before your first meeting to set yourself up for success.

## Coaching Session Tips and Things to Keep in Mind

- Plan to meet with your coach in a quiet, distraction-free space. 

- If you’re not using your phone for the session, silence it and place it somewhere out of reach to avoid temptation. If you are using your phone, turn off notifications to minimize interruptions. 

- Approach your session with an open mind, ready to explore new perspectives and ideas.

### **First Session Flow**

Your first coaching session begins with introductions and an overview of the session structure (30 minutes via Zoom, twice monthly). Your coach will explain the purpose of coaching and how it differs from therapy (see “Coaching vs. Therapy”). You’ll discuss what’s going well, areas you’d like to improve, and your expectations for the coaching relationship. If you’re unsure of your expectations, that’s okay—coaching is entirely personalized to meet you where you are. Together, you and your coach will set goals and identify initial steps to start working toward them. By the end of your first session, you’ll have a few tools to address your goals and a plan for scheduling your subsequent sessions.
