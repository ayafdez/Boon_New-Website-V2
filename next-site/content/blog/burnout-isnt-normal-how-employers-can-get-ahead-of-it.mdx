Let’s get honest about burnout for a moment.

Burnout has become such a staple in our vocabulary that it can often be viewed as an inevitable consequence of existing in the modern workforce. But when it rears its ugly head at an organization, it’s almost always bad news for everyone involved.

An insidious sort of productivity vampire, burnout sucks the life out of employees and drives up costs for employers. It can be prevalent among workforces, sometimes without us even knowing it.

Employers may discover its presence too late when high-performers lose steam or quit.

## The Wider Stats Are Alarming

- 

77% of workers feel burned out.

- Burnout can eat up 20% of payroll budgets.

- 72% of employees are dealing with stress, anxiety, and burnout.

Through our performance management work with over 100 organizations across numerous industries, Boon’s coaches have repeatedly concluded that happy, healthy employees translate to more productive and innovative workplaces.

But too many companies—those that aren’t utilizing consistent, custom solutions like personalized coaching at scale—are missing the mark when seeking to combat burnout. They offer quick fixes instead of tackling the real issues, like stress management and unsteady professional growth.

## The Need for A Better Solution to Burnout is Clear

Consider how stress and burnout are impacting your employee lifecycle and overall results:

- 

83% of U.S. workers stress about work, costing up to $300B in lost productivity.

- 59% of employees consider their mental health crucial when considering new jobs.

**So what’s this solution?**

You need to know what’s going on with your employees' mental well-being. They might need help addressing what’s ailing them from both a personal and professional perspective.

What are your employees feeling, and how can you quantify their struggles? 

Once you have this data, you can consider implementing solutions or programs that promise long-standing effects instead of offering superficial “benefits” that cover up the issue. 

## Boon Exists to Help Answer All These Questions

And to assist you in forming the right long-term solutions.

By personalizing solutions for each employee, Boon coaches help tackle the specific personal and professional challenges holding your employees back individually and probably your organization in aggregate. After the right number of Boon sessions (often ten or more), employees almost always report improved resilience, productivity, and job satisfaction.

With our custom monthly trend reports, high-level company challenges (and progress against them) are also anonymously shared with employers to help provide you with a bird’s-eye view of your workforce's emotional health and professional engagement. From there, you can decide if or when to take action and how to form new programs or initiatives to address common roadblocks to organizational goals.

(You can also let our coaches continue to work with your people, helping them to reach their full potential.)

That’s all great for us to claim, but The Boon Effect has also been well-documented.

Here are some results from over 50,000 coaching sessions (and counting):

- 

85% of employees feel more resilient after coaching

- 82% of Boon users increase productivity

- $3 return for every $1 spent on Boon’s coaching

**"The ability to leverage the sessions for either personal or professional coaching has led to overwhelming positive responses and feedback from our employees."**
- Kerry Shaw, Senior Vice President, People & Culture, The Mars Agency.
