## **Here’s a hard truth:**

Too many employees are silently struggling behind the phrase, *“I’m fine.”* They show up.

They hit deadlines. They even smile on Zoom. But under the surface, they’re tired, overwhelmed, and quietly burning out. And in workplaces where performance is rewarded but vulnerability is quietly punished, that emotional camouflage becomes the norm.

Let’s unpack what this costs—*not just emotionally, but organizationally.*

---

## **The Culture of Pretending**

Most people don’t pretend they’re fine because they want to be dishonest.
They do it because they’ve learned it’s safer to cope quietly than speak up.

Whether it's fear of being seen as weak, a lack of psychological safety, or just the absence of space to check in with themselves, pretending to be fine becomes a survival tactic. One that comes at a serious cost:

- **Lost productivity** from disengagement and emotional exhaustion

- **Quiet quitting** that happens slowly and invisibly

- **Turnover** from people who never felt supported enough to stay

- **Diminished team trust**, where no one knows what’s real anymore

This doesn’t just affect the individual. It affects *everyone* around them.

## **“I’m Fine” as a Performance Trap**

When employees constantly push through without acknowledgment or support, it creates a dangerous feedback loop:

- They feel like they *have* to keep up the act

- Their managers assume everything’s great

- They don’t get help—because no one knows they need it

- Eventually, they hit a breaking point

And by then? It’s often too late to course-correct. They’re already looking for the exit—or mentally checking out.

## **Coaching Interrupts the Cycle**

The solution isn’t to force emotional transparency at every team meeting. It’s to create *spaces* where people can be real—and where performance support includes *personal support.*

That’s what coaching does.

At **Boon**, we make it easy for employees at all levels to access confidential, professional coaching that helps them navigate the internal stuff before it becomes a performance problem.

Our opt-in model meets people where they are. No pressure. No stigma. Just real conversations that help people feel better, so they can perform better.

With **Boon Scale**, employees get 1:1 coaching on both career and personal challenges—from imposter syndrome to communication breakdowns to burnout prevention.

## **Real Talk = Real Performance Gains**

When employees feel safe enough to stop pretending, something powerful happens:

- They make smarter decisions

- They collaborate more effectively

- They stay longer

- And they show up more fully—not just for work, but for themselves

This isn’t a “nice to have.” It’s a **core business strategy**.

## ** Let’s Normalize Not Being Fine (So We Can Actually Fix It)**

Creating space for people to be real isn’t about oversharing or softening standards. It’s about creating resilient, high-performing teams that don’t crumble under the pressure of perfection.

Coaching makes that possible—at scale, affordably, and impactfully.
