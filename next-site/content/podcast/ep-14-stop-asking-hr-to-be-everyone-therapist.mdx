keyTakeaways:
  - "HR is carrying an emotional burden: HR has unintentionally become the therapist, coach, and crisis counselor for organizations—especially since COVID."
  - "Coaching, mentorship, and therapy are not the same: Each serves a different purpose, yet HR professionals are expected to fill all three roles without formal training."
  - "Boundaries build trust: The courage to say I am not equipped to handle this actually increases credibility and safety."
  - "HR identity crisis: The pandemic elevated HR from an administrative function to a core strategic driver."
  - "The future of HR lies in community: HR professionals helping each other through collective support, not heroism."

## About This Episode

Who supports the people who support everyone else? In this episode, Hebba Youssef—founder of the "I Hate It Here" community—opens up about the emotional weight HR professionals carry every day.

They're expected to coach, mentor, and even act like therapists—while managing burnout and unclear boundaries. Most companies don't see the pressure they're under.

We break down the unrealistic expectations placed on HR, the real difference between coaching, mentoring, and therapy, and why leaning on HR for emotional support may be causing more harm than good.

After this episode, you'll never look at your HR team—or your company's "support system"—the same way again.
