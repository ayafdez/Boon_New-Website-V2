## How To Hold Space For Male Vulnerability and Support LGBTQ+ Employees Beyond Pride Month

## Show Notes:

### **Guest: Cator Sparks**

“If you put shame in a petri dish and cover it with judgment, silence, and secrecy, you’ve created the perfect environment for shame to grow until it makes its way into every corner and crevice of your life. If, on the other hand, you put shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy, shame loses its power and begins to wither.” **- Brene Brown**

Boon coach Cator Sparks noticed a void.

There wasn’t enough support for men in the workplace, particularly men dealing with issues such as:

- Loneliness

- Yearning for deeper connections

- Being in their heads and not their bodies

It “sparked” a shift in him, from a career and life in fashion and health in NYC to moving to Charleston, South Carolina, and starting a men’s coaching private practice in 2019.

On this episode of “Have A Better Day,” we have a candid conversation about shame and vulnerability, particularly the intersection of men’s and LGBTQ+ issues.

Inclusion starts with understanding. It moves beyond templates, words, and checked boxes. It takes thoughtful and meaningful action.

Cator had some fascinating things to say about authentic allyship in the workplace. If you’re an HR manager interested in fostering lasting inclusivity beyond Pride Month, watch or listen to the podcast episode.

### **Other topics covered:**

- Ways men can get comfortable with vulnerability

- How to be a real ally that creates change

- Meaningful action vs. surface-level support

PS: We initially hoped to get this episode out during Pride Month in June, but consider it a year-round message from Boon 🙂
