## Show Notes

### Guest: Donna Alexander

Judging by both the hard data and what you constantly seem to hear among executives and people leaders, onboarding is extremely important — and difficult to get right.

Imagine trying to get it right at scale, at a company as large as Amazon.

At Boon, we know a thing or two about how to personalize the employee experience, even at large organizations.

And we’re well aware of the importance of onboarding (since we help some customers with it).

So when I got the chance to speak to Donna Alexander about her experience managing onboarding at Amazon, I was immediately…on board 😉.

Check out what she had to say on “Have A Better Day.”

Such as:

- The three assumptions sabotaging your onboarding process (and how to fix them).

- How Amazon scaled training across 30 countries.

- Which onboarding metrics Amazon tracked maniacally, and how you can do the same

I walked away from our chat with so many actionable takeaways to share with our coaching corps, and to integrate into how we onboard at Boon.

Don’t onboard alone — especially when you can get insider strategies from an industry vet who has seen it all.
