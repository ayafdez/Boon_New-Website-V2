## Show Notes

### Guest: Rumeena Bhalla

I haven’t been shy about sharing [my own struggles](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexbsimmons_limitingbeliefs-leadershipgrowth-personaldevelopment-activity-7188928477427892224-feqm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) with self-doubt, as CEO of Boon.

The LinkedIn post at that link ☝️ is related to our previous episode of the podcast, about limiting beliefs.

I felt that we covered so many important topics in that conversation, but I also saw an opportunity to go deeper into the unique struggles of managing people and teams.

Luckily, physician-turned-leadership coach [Rumeena Bhalla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rumeenabhalla/) was available to chat about what to do when you’re:

- Struggling with self-doubt in a new management role

- Feeling overwhelmed while trying to juggle tasks and strategic work

- Protecting your most important hours each day

I’m such a big fan of Rumeena. This is an empowering episode. Don’t miss it!
