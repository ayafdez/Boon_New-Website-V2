### Scott Fleszar,

CEO of SafeSend

# Can Hybrid Work Fix Office Culture?

 

In this episode, Alex Simmons chats with Scott Fleszar about the evolving workplace dynamics in a post-pandemic world. Alex Simmons chats with Scott Fleszar about the evolving workplace dynamics in a post-pandemic world, focusing on the challenges and benefits of hybrid work. They explore how businesses can balance the flexibility of remote work with the value of in-person collaboration to foster stronger employee engagement and a more vibrant company culture.

Scott shares his personal experiences as a CEO of SafeSend navigating these changes, offering insights on how hybrid models can boost employee engagement, foster a strong company culture, and create a more connected, successful workforce.

Tune in to hear practical tips and strategies for thriving in the new world of work.

### Key Takeaways

### The workplace is still in transition

The discussion underscores that there’s no universal answer to the office vs. remote debate. Different business models, growth stages, and team compositions demand different approaches. What’s clear, however, is that hybrid flexibility is here to stay, and leaders must adapt policies dynamically rather than defaulting to pre-pandemic norms.

*"Organizations are still experimenting — the “right” workplace model depends on who you are, where you are in your growth, and how your teams actually work best."*

### **Leverage has shifted toward employees — but it’s cyclical**

Fleszar and Simmons note that **employee–employer leverage fluctuates with market cycles**. While employees gained flexibility and bargaining power during the pandemic, employers are now regaining influence as the economy tightens. Smart HR leaders will prepare for these swings by balancing empathy with business rigor, ensuring policies remain fair and sustainable even as leverage shifts.

*"It’s not about permanent power on one side — the best companies are building mutual trust that survives market cycles."*

### Benefits and the employee value proposition must evolve

As hybrid and remote models take hold, traditional benefits packages are being reimagined. Employees now value flexibility, mental health support, and learning opportunities as much as traditional perks like health insurance or office lunches. HR leaders need to think holistically about “total rewards,” aligning benefits with how people actually live and work in 2025.

*"The modern benefits landscape is about personalization — meeting people where they are, both physically and emotionally."*

### Culture needs intentional design in distributed teams

With fewer in-person interactions, culture can no longer be left to chance. Leaders must actively design moments of connection and belonging. This includes clear communication rituals, consistent leadership visibility, and recognition systems that cross remote boundaries. HR teams play a crucial role in codifying culture so that it survives growth and decentralization.

*"Hybrid culture isn’t weaker by default — it’s weaker when left unmanaged."*

### The future of work demands continuous experimentation

A shared theme throughout the discussion is that the future of work is a moving target. Organizations should treat their people strategies like product roadmaps—test, learn, iterate. HR and people leaders who adopt an agile mindset will be best equipped to handle rapid changes in technology, workforce expectations, and economic realities.

*"The companies that thrive will be the ones that treat work design as a living experiment, not a fixed policy."*
