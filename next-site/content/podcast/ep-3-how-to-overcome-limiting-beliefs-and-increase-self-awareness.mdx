## Show Notes

### Guest: Jen Spainhour

Do you ever feel held back from your full potential?

I have, at points in my career. It’s still something I have to monitor.

We’re not alone, though. Limiting beliefs can be sneaky, but bringing ourselves into greater awareness around them can help stop us from sabotaging our success.

In this episode of “Have A Better Day,” top coach Jen Spainhour shares how she overcame her own imposter syndrome to become a top performer.

More importantly, she walks us through the framework she uses with her clients to help them break free from the lies they tell themselves.

(Hint: Coaching helps 😉).

Hope you enjoy!
