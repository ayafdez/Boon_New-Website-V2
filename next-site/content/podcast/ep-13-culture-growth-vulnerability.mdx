### Andrew Silver,

Founder and Former CEO of Molo Solutions

# Culture, Growth, and Vulnerability

In this episode, we sit down with Andrew Silver, founder, and former CEO of Molo Solutions, to uncover the incredible journey of transforming a small startup into a $200M logistics powerhouse acquired by ArcBest—all in under five years. Andrew gets raw and honest as he shares the highs and lows of rapid scaling, the complexities of adapting to remote work, and the pivotal role emotional intelligence played in his leadership. He doesn’t hold back on his struggles, hard-earned lessons, and how embracing vulnerability became his greatest strength. Whether you're an entrepreneur or business leader or love stories of resilience and growth, Andrew’s authenticity and actionable insights make this episode an inspiring and unmissable listen.

### Key Takeaways

## Culture starts with strong leadership examples

Silver credits Molo’s early success to leaders who were never above the work. He and co-founder Matt Vogrich built trust and buy-in by modeling the behaviors they wanted others to emulate — resilience, integrity, and responsiveness. They didn’t just talk about work ethic; they lived it, setting a tone that inspired others to “do whatever it takes.”

*“The best entrepreneurs are the ones who inspire others to want to do whatever it takes.”*

## Storytelling is a culture-building superpower

Silver hosted biweekly company-wide meetings to reinforce values and recognize wins through storytelling. He’d highlight real examples of employees solving customer problems, connecting individual effort to broader business outcomes.

*“Giving people praise is such an inexpensive way to garner buy-in… words mean a lot.”*

### ** Integrity must be operational — not just an ideal**

Molo’s culture of integrity wasn’t just a poster on the wall; it was embedded in systems and rules that governed daily decisions. For instance, they designed internal policies to prevent unethical behavior — such as shortchanging truck drivers on payments — and made those non-negotiable.

*“Don’t set values because they look good on paper. Build systems that ensure you live them every day.”*

### **Culture can't scale without intention**

During the pandemic, Silver initially embraced remote work after witnessing high productivity and trust. But as Molo doubled in size, the limitations of remote onboarding and cultural transmission became clear. New hires lacked the osmosis that happened in-office, and connection waned.

*“It’s different strokes for different folks… but if only 20% come to the office, you may lose the magic that builds culture.”*

### ** Vulnerability is the future of leadership**

Silver shared openly about his personal struggles, the pain of losing control after Molo’s acquisition, and the personal growth that came from executive coaching. He believes that **self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and vulnerability** are the defining traits of modern leadership.

*“The best leaders will be the ones who leverage vulnerability to connect more deeply. You have to be your authentic self — that’s how people trust you.”*
