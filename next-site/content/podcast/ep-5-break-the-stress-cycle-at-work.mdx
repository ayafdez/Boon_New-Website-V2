## Show Notes: Break the Stress Cycle at Work

### Guest: Dr. Kimberly Byrd

I know I struggle with stress and chaos addiction at work.

As a CEO, there’s so much I’m responsible for.

So much that I sometimes forget to follow the reasonable, data-backed advice our coaches deliver to customers and clients of Boon every day.

The advice to take some control back, when it comes to reactivity vs. proactivity.

If you feel like your workforce is drowning all day, among the demands to “always be on” at work, this new episode of “Have A Better Day” with Dr. Kimberly Byrd is a must-listen.

To combat burnout on the individual level — and to empower employees to get ahead of it on the organizational level — we often need to make different choices.

In this talk, Kim details:

- How modern work culture has created an addiction to stress and chaos

- Strategies for regaining control and setting boundaries — that your people can start using today to combat burnout

- Why empathy across your employees and managers is key to reducing panic

And so many more takeaways that will surely help you and your people to walk back from this very real problem at so many well-meaning companies.
