# Show Notes

### Guest: Alex Seiler

It can be rare to meet someone in the HR or people leader space who manages to speak candidly while illustrating clear thoughtfulness and compassion.

Alex Seiler is one of those people.

I’ve been following him on LinkedIn for a while because of his open, honest, and sometimes personal views on the issues facing HR leaders and executives at today’s companies.

So, I was excited to talk to him for this second of our two episodes, which is themed around Mental Health Awareness Month.

In this installment of “Have a Better Day” Alex and I discuss:

- His own experience with depression and anxiety

- The importance of balancing team care with self-care

- How to start meaningful conversations about mental health with leadership

As CEO of Boon — which exists primarily due to my growth journeys in mental well-being and professional development — I frequently grapple with challenges like these.

There’s no getting around the stress of leading a startup.

But, as Alex and I have both learned, there are ways to balance work pressure with the personal needs we all have as human beings.

Listen in for Alex’s well-earned insights into how to prioritize mental well-being in the workplace without losing yourself in the process.
