# Goal Setting That Actually Works:

# Overcoming Overwhelm and Staying on Track

Watch on **Youtube** for the transcript.

Most people start the year with ambitious goals—whether it’s getting a promotion, launching a business, or improving personal habits. But too often, motivation fades, overwhelm creeps in, and progress stalls. Why? Because setting goals is one thing—sustaining them is another.

### The Challenges of Goal Setting

People struggle with:

- Feeling stuck when faced with too many competing priorities

- Losing motivation when progress is slower than expected

- Pushing too hard, leading to burnout instead of long-term success

### What Really Works

Achieving meaningful goals requires more than just willpower. It involves:

- **Breaking goals into actionable steps** – Start with the outcome in mind, but work backwards to create a realistic, flexible plan.

- **Shifting your mindset** – Growth doesn’t have to be fast. Embracing progress over perfection is key to staying motivated.

- **Tracking success in a way that works for you** – Whether it’s journaling, vision boards, accountability partners, or structured time blocks, the best system is the one that fits your style.

- **Prioritizing well-being** – High achievers often neglect self-care, but true success includes sustainability, not just productivity.
