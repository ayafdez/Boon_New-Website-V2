In today’s demanding work environments, prioritizing mental health has never been more critical. Employees face mounting pressures that blur the lines between personal and professional life. This webinar, featuring NBA Champion Metta Sandiford-Artest and renowned organizational researcher Dr. Monica Warland, delves into the importance of mental well-being in the workplace.

The session provides actionable strategies to help organizations foster a culture of compassion, build resilience, and support employee growth.

#### Why Mental Well-Being Matters at Work

When employees neglect their mental health, it impacts not just their personal lives but also their workplace performance. Stress, anxiety, and burnout lead to reduced productivity and increased turnover. As the saying goes, “No one can pour from an empty cup.” Employees must take care of themselves to thrive at work.

Metta Sandiford-Artest shared his journey of self-discovery and healing through therapy and mindfulness. His story serves as a testament to the power of addressing mental health proactively.

#### Compassion: The Key to Thriving Organizations

Dr. Monica Warland emphasized the transformative role of compassion in workplace culture. Her research reveals that compassion fosters psychological safety, where employees feel supported in expressing challenges and taking risks.

“Compassion isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a foundation for strength,” she explained. By encouraging employees to care for themselves and others, organizations unlock creativity, resilience, and deeper engagement.
