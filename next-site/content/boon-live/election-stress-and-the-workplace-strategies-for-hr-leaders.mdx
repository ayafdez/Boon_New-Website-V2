To say that political tensions are high as we approach the 2024 presidential election would be an understatement. This heightened election stress inevitably seeps into the workplace, creating challenges for HR leaders and people managers who must navigate the complexities of political tension among employees.

At Boon, we understand that election stress doesn’t respect boundaries between work and personal lives. Widespread cultural instability often brings stress directly into professional spaces, impacting engagement, morale, and team dynamics. Addressing election stress in the workplace is essential for maintaining a positive and productive environment.

#### Why Election Stress Impacts Workplaces

Political tensions can create friction between employees, disrupt team cohesion, and increase overall stress levels. Stress often triggers emotional reactions that affect workplace interactions and decision-making. Without intervention, this stress can lead to disengagement, absenteeism, or even conflict.
