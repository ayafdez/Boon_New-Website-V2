topicSummary: "AI is reshaping L&D faster than most teams can adapt. This session brought together HR leaders from I Hate It Here, SurveyMonkey, and Boon to discuss why AI-first strategies fail without culture, how L&D is evolving into reskilling engines, and what the future holds for coaching and career development."
speakersJson: '[{"name": "Hebba Youssef", "title": "Chief People Officer", "company": "I Hate It Here"}, {"name": "Kailey Cartwright", "title": "Global Lead, Learning & Development", "company": "SurveyMonkey"}, {"name": "Alex Simmons", "title": "Founder & CEO", "company": "Boon"}]'
keyTakeaways:
  - "AI isn't the strategy—mindset is: Adoption means nothing without cultural readiness."
  - "L&D must evolve into Reskilling & Development: Replace rigid programs with agile, skills-first learning."
  - "The manager role is being unbundled: Most can't coach 10+ directs—expect tech and third parties to fill the gap."
  - "Career paths are going nonlinear: Skills > titles. Growth will be dynamic and AI-augmented."
  - "Culture beats tooling: Power hours and Slack threads outperformed formal training in driving adoption."

## What We Discussed

In this session, we explored:

- Why "AI-first" strategies fall flat without curiosity, culture, and core competencies
- How leading companies are reshaping L&D into reskilling engines
- Real-world experiments in manager enablement, tool adoption, and org-wide upskilling
- The future of coaching, career paths, and management itself

Leadership development is changing fast. We're helping teams rethink how they build adaptability, skills, and culture at scale.
