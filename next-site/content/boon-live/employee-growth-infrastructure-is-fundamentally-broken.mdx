Traditional employee development strategies are failing to meet the needs of today’s dynamic workplaces. Leaders are investing in wellness programs, trendy perks, and engagement apps. However, these efforts often miss the mark, neglecting the core challenges of employee growth and connection.

The result? Increased turnover, disengaged teams, and a growing disconnect between organizational goals and individual development. A fundamental shift in employee growth infrastructure is urgently needed.

Join Alex Newman, Boon’s Director of Partnerships, alongside Chief People Officer Alex Seiler and Intrepid Vietnam CEO Emmanuelle Gounot as they discuss actionable solutions to improve employee growth strategies.

#### Why Current Strategies Fail Employee Growth

Many leaders turn to short-term perks, such as wellness apps and free snacks. While these can boost morale briefly, they fail to address the root causes of disengagement and stagnation. Companies need a more holistic approach for employee growth to thrive.

#### The Missing Pieces in Employee Development Strategies

Most companies overlook critical elements that empower employees to grow. Without these, efforts to boost engagement often fall flat. During the webinar, experts shared practical ways to bridge these gaps and create impactful growth strategies.

#### A Whole-Human Approach to Growth

Fostering personal and professional development together is essential. Employees must feel valued as whole individuals. This approach not only enhances growth but also strengthens workplace culture and aligns personal aspirations with company goals.

#### Boon GROW: Redefining Employee Coaching

Boon’s innovative GROW program is transforming how companies approach employee coaching. Through personalized, actionable strategies, it drives measurable growth and engagement. This program represents a bold step toward sustainable employee development.

By embracing strategies that support employees as complete individuals, your organization can reduce turnover, foster engagement, and create a thriving culture of growth.
